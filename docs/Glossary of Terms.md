## **A**

**Active Return**  
: The difference between the portfolio's return and the benchmark's return. It is the value that **Performance Attribution** seeks to explain.  

**Attribution**  
: A method for analyzing a portfolio's **active return** to determine whether it was driven by a manager's **allocation decisions**, **selection decisions**, or their **interaction**.  

---

## **C**

**Carino Smoothing**  
: A mathematical algorithm used to link single-period (daily) contributions over a multi-period horizon. It correctly accounts for compounding effects, ensuring that the **sum of smoothed contributions** equals the portfolio‚Äôs total **geometric Time-Weighted Return**.  

**Contribution**  
: A method for decomposing a portfolio's total return to show how much each **position** or **group** contributed to the final result.

## **K**

**Karnosky-Singer Model**  
: An attribution model specifically designed for **multi-currency portfolios**. It decomposes active return into four components:  
- Local allocation  
- Local selection  
- Currency allocation  
- Currency selection (interaction)  

This helps isolate the value generated from **local market decisions** versus **currency timing decisions**.

## **M**

**Money-Weighted Return (MWR)**  
: A measure of an investor's **personal rate of return**, heavily influenced by the **size and timing of cash flows**.  
- Answers: *‚ÄúWhat was my actual return on the money I invested?‚Äù*  

---

## **T**

**Time-Weighted Return (TWR)**  
: A measure of a portfolio's **compounded growth rate**, neutralizing the effects of **cash flows**.  
- Industry standard for evaluating **investment strategy or manager performance**.  
- Answers: *‚ÄúHow well did the portfolio‚Äôs assets perform?‚Äù*  

---

## **X**

**XIRR (eXtended Internal Rate of Return)**  
: The primary method used to calculate **MWR**.  
- Finds the single discount rate that makes the **net present value (NPV)** of all cash flows (including start & end values) equal to zero.  
- Highly accurate for portfolios with **irregular cash flows**.
