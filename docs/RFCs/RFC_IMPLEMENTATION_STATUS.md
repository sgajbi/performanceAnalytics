# RFC Implementation Status

This document provides a summary of the implementation status for all RFCs related to the `performanceAnalytics` service. It also outlines a strategic, sequential roadmap for implementing the remaining features to build a cohesive and powerful analytics suite.

This roadmap has been updated to prioritize foundational, cross-cutting enhancements to platform robustness, auditability, and multi-currency capabilities before proceeding with new analytical features.

## Proposed Implementation Roadmap

The following RFCs are not yet implemented. This roadmap presents a logical order for their development, prioritizing platform stability and core capabilities first.

### Phase 1: Harden the Foundation

1.  **RFC 024 — Robustness Policies**
    * **Reasoning:** **Build on a resilient core.** Before adding new analytics, we must ensure the entire platform can handle real-world, messy data predictably. This RFC introduces a configurable framework for managing outliers, gaps, and zero-denominators, making all existing and future calculations more trustworthy.

2.  **RFC 025 — Deterministic Reproducibility & Drill-Down**
    * **Reasoning:** **Ensure auditability and transparency.** Once calculations are robust, they must be reproducible. The `calculation_hash` and drill-down endpoints are critical for validation, debugging, and building client trust. This benefits the entire platform.

3.  **RFC 020 — Multi-Currency & FX-Aware Performance**
    * **Reasoning:** **Address a fundamental domain requirement.** Real-world portfolios are multi-currency. This RFC extends the core engines to handle FX translation and hedging, a foundational requirement before building more advanced, cross-asset analytics.

### Phase 2: Expand Core Analytical Views

4.  **RFC 009 — Exposure Breakdown API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Establish the "present state" view.** With a robust, auditable, and multi-currency aware platform, this is the first major feature to build. It answers "What am I exposed to?" and is the prerequisite for most other portfolio management analytics.

5.  **RFC 013 — Active Analytics API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Unify the active management story.** This API directly connects the existing active return analysis with the new active exposure analysis from RFC 009, creating a complete, benchmark-relative view for portfolio managers.

6.  **RFC 011 — Scenario Analysis & Stress Tests API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Introduce forward-looking risk.** A major expansion of capability that uses the sensitivities aggregated by RFC 009. It moves the platform from analyzing what *has happened* and *is happening* to what *could happen*.

7.  **RFC 007 — Asset Allocation Drift Monitoring API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Create an actionable workflow.** This provides the core rebalancing workflow for portfolio managers ("Am I aligned with my strategy?"), turning the insights from RFC 009 into concrete actions.

### Phase 3: Deepen and Specialize Analytics

8.  **RFC 012 — Risk-Adjusted Returns & Stats API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Deepen performance analysis.** This significantly enhances the "Performance" pillar with industry-standard statistics like Sharpe Ratio, VaR, and drawdown analysis.

9.  **RFC 005 — Portfolio Correlation Matrix API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Expand statistical risk.** A complementary feature to RFC 012 that adds a key view on diversification and intra-portfolio risk.

10. **RFC 021 — Fees, Taxes & Transaction-Cost Decomposition**
    * **Reasoning:** **Provide granular Gross-to-Net transparency.** An advanced feature that decomposes the impact of all costs on performance, enhancing the detail of the core TWR and Contribution engines.

11. **RFC 026 — Transaction-Based "Trading Effect"**
    * **Reasoning:** **Enhance attribution with trading insights.** A specialized extension to the attribution engine that isolates the impact of in-period trading decisions.

### Phase 4: Add Enabling and Enterprise-Level Features

12. **RFC 008 & 010 — Fixed-Income Metrics & Equity Factor Exposures APIs**
    * **Reasoning:** **Enrich data with specialized models.** These are enabling services that provide deeper, asset-class-specific data (e.g., precise durations, factor exposures) that make the entire suite of tools more powerful.

13. **RFC 023 — Blended & Dynamic Benchmarks**
    * **Reasoning:** **Support advanced use cases.** This feature allows for complex, time-varying benchmarks, a requirement for sophisticated institutional clients.

14. **RFC 022 — Composite & Sleeve Aggregation**
    * **Reasoning:** **Enable firm-level and GIPS-compliant reporting.** This is a major enterprise feature that aggregates results from multiple portfolios into composites, representing the pinnacle of the platform's capabilities.
