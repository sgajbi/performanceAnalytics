# RFC Implementation Status

## Governance Boundary

- Service-specific PA implementation RFCs are maintained in this repository.
- Cross-cutting platform and multi-service architecture decisions are maintained in:
  `https://github.com/sgajbi/pbwm-platform-docs`

This document provides a summary of the implementation status for all RFCs related to the `performanceAnalytics` service. It also outlines a strategic, sequential roadmap for implementing the remaining features to build a cohesive and powerful analytics suite.

## Proposed Implementation Roadmap

The following RFCs are not yet implemented. This roadmap presents a logical order for their development, prioritizing foundational capabilities that enable more advanced analytics.

### Phase 1: Foundational Enhancements

1.  **RFC 029 — Unified Multi-Period Analysis Framework**
    * **Reasoning:** **Dramatically improve API efficiency and usability.** This is a top priority as it fundamentally changes how clients perform comparative analysis, reducing multiple redundant calls to a single, optimized request.

2.  **RFC 024 — Robustness Policies**
    * **Reasoning:** **Build on a resilient core.** This is a prerequisite for handling real-world, messy data predictably, making all existing and future calculations more trustworthy.

3.  **RFC 021 — Gross-to-Net Return Decomposition**
    * **Reasoning:** **Provide critical fee transparency.** A foundational feature for any auditable reporting, explaining the impact of fees and costs on performance.

4.  **RFC 023 — Blended & Dynamic Benchmarks**
    * **Reasoning:** **Enable correct active analysis.** Many strategies are measured against dynamic, not static, benchmarks. This is essential for accurate attribution and active analytics.

### Phase 2: Expand Core Analytical Views

5.  **RFC 009 — Exposure Breakdown API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Establish the "present state" view.** This is the first major new analytical feature to build, answering "What am I exposed to?" and serving as a prerequisite for most other portfolio management analytics.

6.  **RFC 013 — Active Analytics API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Unify the active management story.** This API directly connects existing active return analysis with the new active exposure analysis from RFC 009, creating a complete, benchmark-relative view.

7.  **RFC 007 — Asset Allocation Drift Monitoring API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Create an actionable workflow.** This provides the core rebalancing workflow for portfolio managers, turning the insights from RFC 009 into concrete actions.

8.  **RFC 011 — Scenario Analysis & Stress Tests API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Introduce forward-looking risk.** A major expansion of capability that uses the sensitivities aggregated by RFC 009, moving the platform from historical analysis to what *could happen*.

### Phase 3: Deepen and Specialize Analytics

9.  **RFC 012 — Risk-Adjusted Returns & Stats API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Deepen performance analysis.** Significantly enhances the "Performance" pillar with industry-standard statistics like Sharpe Ratio, VaR, and drawdown analysis.

10. **RFC 005 — Portfolio Correlation Matrix API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Expand statistical risk.** A complementary feature to RFC 012 that adds a key view on diversification and intra-portfolio risk.

11. **RFC 026 — Attribution Trading Effect**
    * **Reasoning:** **Enhance attribution with trading insights.** A specialized extension to the attribution engine that isolates the impact of in-period trading decisions.

### Phase 4: Add Enabling and Enterprise-Level Features

12. **RFC 008 & 010 — Fixed-Income Metrics & Equity Factor Exposures APIs**
    * **Reasoning:** **Enrich data with specialized models.** These are enabling services that provide deeper, asset-class-specific data (e.g., precise durations, factor exposures) that make the entire suite of tools more powerful.

13. **RFC 022 — Composite & Sleeve Aggregation API**
    * **Reasoning:** **Enable firm-level and GIPS-compliant reporting.** A major enterprise feature that aggregates results from multiple portfolios into composites, representing the pinnacle of the platform's capabilities.
