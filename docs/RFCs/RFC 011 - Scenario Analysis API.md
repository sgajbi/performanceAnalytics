# RFC 011: Scenario Analysis API (Final)

**Status:** Final (For Approval)
**Owner:** Senior Architect
**Reviewers:** Perf Engine, Risk, Platform
**Related:** RFC-009 (Exposure Breakdown), RFC-008 (Fixed-Income Metrics)

## 1\. Executive Summary

This document specifies the final design for a new, forward-looking **Scenario Analysis & Stress Tests API** to be implemented at `/analytics/scenario`. The existing and planned services provide a comprehensive view of a portfolio's historical performance and current exposures. This API introduces the critical third pillar of analysis: understanding potential future outcomes by simulating the impact of market shocks.

The engine will provide a powerful, on-demand risk management utility capable of running three distinct types of scenarios: **hypothetical** (user-defined shocks), **historical** (replaying past market events), and **probabilistic** (Monte Carlo simulations). It will calculate the potential Profit & Loss (P\&L) at the instrument, group, and portfolio levels, with clear attribution to the underlying risk factors.

The API is designed for maximum flexibility, allowing users to choose between a fast, **sensitivity-based** approximation (using inputs like delta, gamma, DV01, and beta) and a more precise **full repricing** method for fixed-income instruments. The implementation will be integrated into our existing architecture, reusing foundational components and adhering to our highest standards of correctness, scalability, and resilience.

## 2\. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

  * Provide a stateless API to run scenario analysis and stress tests.
  * Support `hypothetical`, `historical`, and `monte_carlo` scenario modes.
  * Compute P\&L using either first/second-order **sensitivities** or **full repricing**.
  * Break down results by **risk factor** and by any **classification dimension** (e.g., asset class, sector).
  * For Monte Carlo mode, compute key tail risk metrics like **VaR (Value at Risk)** and **CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk)**.

### Non-Goals

  * The service will not source market data or sensitivities; the caller must provide all necessary inputs.
  * Advanced greeks for exotic derivatives are out of scope for v1.
  * The engine will not perform portfolio optimization or recommend hedges.

## 3\. Methodology

### 3.1. Valuation Methods

The engine supports two methods for calculating P\&L from a given shock.

1.  **Sensitivity-Based (Default)**: A fast and efficient method that approximates P\&L using an instrument's risk sensitivities.

      * **First-Order (Linear) P\&L**: $\\Delta V \\approx \\sum\_{f} S\_f \\cdot \\Delta f$, where $S\_f$ is the instrument's sensitivity to factor *f* (e.g., DV01, Beta) and $\\Delta f$ is the factor shock.
      * **Second-Order P\&L**: Includes curvature effects for a more accurate approximation: $\\Delta V \\approx \\sum\_{f} S\_f \\cdot \\Delta f + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum\_{f} \\Gamma\_f \\cdot (\\Delta f)^2$, where $\\Gamma\_f$ is the gamma or convexity.

2.  **Full Repricing**: A more accurate but computationally intensive method for fixed-income instruments. Instead of using sensitivities, the engine applies the scenario shocks directly to the yield curve and/or spread curve and fully reprices the instrument's cash flows. This naturally captures convexity and other non-linear effects.

### 3.2. Shock Application by Factor

The engine translates abstract scenario definitions into concrete P\&L calculations.

  * **Rates Shocks**: A parallel shift of `+100bp` is applied to all relevant tenors. The P\&L is calculated as $\\Delta V \\approx - \\sum\_{t} KRD\_t \\cdot (0.01)$. If only DV01 is provided, it's used as an approximation: $\\Delta V \\approx -DV01 \\cdot 100$.
  * **Equity Shocks**: For a shock of `-10%`, the P\&L is calculated as $\\Delta V \\approx \\beta \\cdot MV\_{equity} \\cdot (-0.10)$. For derivatives, the P\&L is $\\Delta V \\approx \\delta \\cdot \\text{UnderlyingNotional} \\cdot (-0.10)$.
  * **Credit & FX Shocks**: Similar logic is applied using Spread DV01 and FX delta sensitivities.

### 3.3. Scenario Modes

  * **Hypothetical**: The user provides an explicit set of shocks in the `scenario.layers` array.
  * **Historical**: The user specifies a historical window (e.g., the 2008 crisis). The engine uses the factor movements from that period (which must be supplied by the caller) as the shocks.
  * **Monte Carlo**: The engine generates thousands of random, correlated factor shocks based on user-provided statistical inputs (mean, volatility, correlation matrix). It calculates the P\&L for each path, creating a distribution of potential outcomes from which VaR and CVaR are derived.

### 4.4. HTTP Semantics & Errors

  * **200 OK**: Successful computation.
  * **400 Bad Request**: Schema or validation errors.
  * **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Request is valid, but data is insufficient (e.g., sensitivities missing for all instruments).
  * **413 Payload Too Large**: Request payload exceeds configured limits.

## 5\. Architecture & Implementation Plan

1.  **Create new modules**:
      * `engine/scenarios.py`: To house the core logic for shock application, P\&L calculation, and Monte Carlo simulation.
      * `app/models/scenario_requests.py` and `app/models/scenario_responses.py`: To define the API contract.
2.  **Create new endpoint router**:
      * Create `app/api/endpoints/analytics.py` with a router for `/analytics`.
      * Implement the `POST /analytics/scenario` endpoint.
3.  **Update `main.py`**:
      * Register the new `/analytics` router with the FastAPI application.

## 6\. Testing & Validation Strategy

  * **Unit Tests**: The new `engine/scenarios.py` module must achieve **100% test coverage**. This will include validating P\&L calculations against manual, formula-based results for each sensitivity type (DV01, KRD, beta, delta, convexity), as well as testing the Monte Carlo engine's statistical properties (e.g., mean, variance) with a fixed seed.
  * **Integration Tests**: API-level tests will validate the end-to-end flow for each of the three modes (`hypothetical`, `historical`, `monte_carlo`), ensuring that request flags correctly control the engine's behavior and that the response structure is accurate.
  * **Characterization Test**: A test will be created using a realistic multi-asset portfolio and a composite shock. The API's P\&L results will be validated against a reference calculation from a Jupyter notebook to ensure numerical correctness.
  * **Overall Coverage**: The overall project test coverage must remain at or above **95%**.
