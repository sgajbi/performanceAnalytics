# RFC 022: Composite & Sleeve Aggregation API (Final)

**Status:** Final (For Approval)
**Owner:** Senior Architect
**Reviewers:** Perf Engine, Risk, Platform, Compliance
**Related:** All core analytics endpoints, RFC-025 (Reproducibility)

## 1\. Executive Summary

This document specifies the final design for a new, enterprise-grade **Composite & Sleeve Aggregation** capability. This feature is a major evolution of the platform, extending its analytical power from individual portfolios to firm-level, strategy-based composites. This is a critical requirement for asset management firms seeking to report performance in a manner consistent with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS).

The framework introduces a new set of endpoints under `/composites/*` that wrap our core analytics engines (TWR, MWR, Contribution, Attribution). It allows users to define a composite's membership, including rules for inclusion/exclusion, significant cash flows, and discretionary status. The engine supports the two primary GIPS-accepted calculation methods: the **Aggregate Method** (building a single virtual portfolio) and the **Asset-Weighted Average Method**.

This API will produce not only the composite's performance but also key GIPS-aware statistics like the number of portfolios, composite assets, and return dispersion. This is a foundational feature for institutional-level reporting, providing a robust, auditable, and reproducible way to aggregate performance across a firm's strategies.

## 2\. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

  * Provide a stateless API to aggregate performance and analytics for a group of portfolios (a composite).
  * Support both the **Aggregate** and **Asset-Weighted Average** calculation methods.
  * Implement GIPS-aware rules for portfolio inclusion/exclusion and significant cash flows.
  * Calculate and return standard composite statistics, including asset-weighted return dispersion.
  * Handle **sleeves (carve-outs)** with dedicated cash allocations.
  * Apply consistently across TWR, MWR, Contribution, and Attribution.

### Non-Goals

  * The API will not serve as a persistent, firm-wide registry of composites.
  * It will not automatically generate GIPS-compliant marketing presentations or disclosures.
  * It is not a substitute for a firm's formal compliance system but provides the necessary calculation tools.

## 3\. Methodology

The engine follows a multi-step process: first resolving the composite's membership for the period, then calculating the result using the chosen method.

### 3.1. Membership Resolution

For each period, the engine determines which member portfolios are included in the composite based on a set of rules:

  * **Eligibility**: A portfolio must be marked as `discretionary` (if required), be within its `join` and `leave` dates, and meet any `min_aum` threshold.
  * **Significant Cash Flow (SCF) Policy**: If a portfolio experiences a cash flow exceeding a percentage threshold, it can be temporarily excluded for that period to avoid distorting performance, as defined by the `scf_policy.treatment`.

### 3.2. Composite Calculation Methods

  * **Aggregate Method (Default)**: This method is the most robust. The engine constructs a single **virtual composite portfolio** by summing the market values, cash flows, and fees of all included members on a daily basis. The standard TWR (or other) calculation is then run on this single, aggregated data panel. This naturally handles all intra-period cash flows and membership changes.
  * **Asset-Weighted Average Method**: This method calculates the return for each member portfolio individually for a given period (e.g., monthly). The composite's return for that period is then the asset-weighted average of the individual member returns. The weights are typically the beginning-of-period market values. These periodic composite returns are then geometrically linked to get the total return.

### 3.3. Sleeve (Carve-Out) Handling

For sleeves to be compliant, they must be managed with their own cash allocation. The `cash_allocation_method` in the request ensures this is handled correctly. If `exclude_from_parent` is true, the sleeve's assets and flows are removed from the parent account's data before it is considered for any composite, preventing double-counting.

### 3.4. GIPS-Aware Statistics

  * **Dispersion**: For any period where the composite contains a minimum number of portfolios (e.g., 6), the engine calculates the cross-sectional standard deviation of the member returns to measure how consistently the strategy was applied.

## 4\. API Design

### 4.1. Endpoints

A new set of wrapper endpoints will be created:

  * `POST /composites/twr`
  * `POST /composites/mwr`
  * `POST /composites/contribution`
  * `POST /composites/attribution`

  },
  "breakdowns": { /* Standard TWR breakdowns for the composite */ },
  "meta": { ... },
  "diagnostics": { ... },
  "audit": { ... }
}
```

### 4.4. HTTP Semantics & Errors

  * **200 OK**: Successful computation.
  * **400 Bad Request**: Invalid composite specification.
  * **409 Conflict**: An exclusivity violation is detected (e.g., a portfolio is in two composites where it should not be).
  * **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Request is valid, but data is insufficient (e.g., no members qualify for the period).

## 5\. Architecture & Implementation Plan

1.  **Create New Modules**:
      * `engine/composite.py`: To house the logic for membership resolution, panel aggregation, and dispersion calculation.
      * `app/models/composite_common.py`: To define the shared request/response models.
      * `app/api/endpoints/composites.py`: To define the new `/composites/*` router and endpoints.
2.  **Implementation**: The composite endpoints will act as wrappers. They will first call the `engine/composite.py` module to resolve membership and create the single, aggregated data panel. This panel will then be passed to the existing single-portfolio engines (`engine/compute.py`, `engine/attribution.py`, etc.) for the final calculation.

## 6\. Testing & Validation Strategy

  * **Unit Tests**: The new `engine/composite.py` module must achieve **100% test coverage**. This includes tests for all membership rules (join/leave, SCF, min AUM), the two aggregation methods, and sleeve cash allocation logic.
  * **Integration Tests**: API-level tests will be created for each of the four `/composites/*` endpoints, validating the end-to-end flow and the GIPS-aware summary statistics.
  * **Characterization Test**: A test will be created for a multi-portfolio composite over several years with membership changes. The output will be validated against a reference calculation from a GIPS-compliant system or a detailed reference spreadsheet.
  * **Overall Coverage**: The overall project test coverage must remain at or above **95%**.
