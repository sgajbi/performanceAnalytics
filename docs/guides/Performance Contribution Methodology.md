## Performance Contribution Methodology

This document details the mathematical and logical foundations of the performance contribution engine. The engine is designed to work in tandem with the portfolio-level performance engine, using the same core formulas and respecting portfolio-level events.

The calculation provides three key outputs for each position ($p$):
* **Position Rate of Return ($RoR_p$)**: The performance of the individual position.
* **Position Average Weight ($W_p$)**: The average weight of the position relative to the total portfolio.
* **Position Contribution ($C_p$)**: The position's total contribution to the portfolio's return.

### 1. Data Requirements

The contribution engine requires a time series for each individual position with a structure similar to the portfolio-level data, including:
* Beginning and End of Day Market Values (`BMV_p`, `EMV_p`)
* Beginning and End of Day Cash Flows (`BOD_CF_p`, `EOD_CF_p`)

### 2. Single-Period Calculation

For a single time period (e.g., one day), the contribution is calculated with the following components.

#### Position Rate of Return ($RoR_p$)
This uses the same Modified Dietz formula as the main performance engine but is applied at the individual position level.

$$RoR_p = \frac{(EMV_p - BMV_p - CF_p)}{(BMV_p + CF_{p,w})}$$

* **$EMV_p$**: End Market Value of the position.
* **$BMV_p$**: Beginning Market Value of the position.
* **$CF_p$**: Net cash flow of the position.
* **$CF_{p,w}$**: Weighted cash flow of the position.

#### Position Average Weight ($W_p$)
This represents the position's average capital as a fraction of the portfolio's total average capital for the period.

$$W_p = \frac{(BMV_p + CF_{p,w})}{(BMV_{port} + CF_{port,w})}$$

* **$BMV_{port}$**: Beginning Market Value of the total portfolio.
* **$CF_{port,w}$**: Weighted cash flow of the total portfolio.

#### Position Contribution ($C_p$)
The contribution for a single period is the position's return multiplied by its average weight.

$$C_p = W_p \times RoR_p$$

### 3. Multi-Period Calculation (Carino Smoothing)

Over multiple time periods, the simple sum of single-period contributions will not equal the total portfolio return due to compounding. To resolve this, the **Carino Smoothing Algorithm** is used to link the contributions over time.

#### Step 1: Calculate Smoothing Factors

Two types of smoothing factors are required, based on the **portfolio-level returns**.

* **Daily Smoothing Factor ($k_t$)**: Calculated for each day `t` based on that day's total portfolio return ($RoR_{port,t}$).
    $$k_t = \frac{\ln(1 + RoR_{port,t})}{RoR_{port,t}}$$

* **Total Period Smoothing Factor ($K$)**: Calculated once for the entire multi-period timeframe based on the total, geometrically-linked portfolio return ($RoR_{port}$).
    $$K = \frac{\ln(1 + RoR_{port})}{RoR_{port}}$$

* **Exception Handling**: If any portfolio return ($RoR_{port,t}$ or $RoR_{port}$) is zero, the corresponding smoothing factor (`k_t` or `K`) is set to **1**.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Total Smoothed Contribution ($C'_{p, total}$)
The final contribution for a position is the sum of its "smoothed contributions" from each day.

First, the **Smoothed Contribution for a single period ($C'_{p,t}$)** is calculated by adding an adjustment factor to the original contribution. This factor re-allocates the portfolio's geometric excess to each position based on its weight.

$$C'_{p,t} = C_{p,t} + \left( W_{p,t} \times \left( RoR_{port,t} \times \left( \frac{K}{k_t} - 1 \right) \right) \right)$$

The **Total Smoothed Contribution** for a position is then the simple sum of these adjusted, single-period contributions.

$$C'_{p, total} = \sum_{t=1}^{N} C'_{p,t}$$

### 4. Integration with Portfolio-Level Events

To ensure accuracy, the contribution of a position is directly affected by events calculated at the total portfolio level.

#### Handling of No Investment Period (NIP) Days
If a given day `t` is flagged as a `NIP` day for the **total portfolio**, the contribution for **all positions** on that day is **zero**. A NIP day signifies no capital was invested, so no performance can be attributed to any position.

#### Handling of Performance Reset Days
If a given day `t` is flagged as a `reset` day for the **total portfolio** (due to an `NCTRL` flag), the contribution for **all positions** on that day is also **zero**. A portfolio reset signifies that the cumulative performance is restarting from zero. Setting the contribution to zero on that day ensures the sum of contributions remains consistent with the portfolio's reset event.
